  Pregnancy rates in the United States rose from 1980 to a peak in 1990, and have since been in decline, with the exception of a brief increase in 2006-2007(Curtin 2013: 4). The decline in pregnancy rates is probably the main factor driving the decline in the abortion rate. It appears as though the rate of pregnancies ending in abortion decreased from 23% in 1990 to 18% in 2009(Curtin Data, my analysis). According to the Guttmacher Policy Review, between 2008 and 2011, the proportion of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion did not change (Dreweke 2016: 2), despite the fact that the abortion rate dropped 25% from 2008 to 2014(Jones 2017:1). It's less clear how TRAP laws affect abortion rates in particular areas(Grossman).\
  

##Data Visualizations and Analysis

For all the graphs below, rates are pregnancy outcomes per 1,000 women in specified group, estimated as of April 1 for 1990, 2000, and 2010, July 1 for all other years. All data comes from <https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db136_tables.pdf#2>, table #2 from the Curtin source.\
\
If there's any other age and race breakdowns in particular I should examine, I'm able to easily do so now that I have everything set up. 

### Pregnancy Rates by Race, 1990-2009

                      breaks = c("All Races", "White NH", "Hispanic All Races", "Black NH"),
                      values = c("violetred1", "seagreen4", "blue","darkmagenta"))

###Pregnancy Rates and Abortion Rates Comparison
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=pregnancies_all)+
  geom_point(aes(x=year,y=total,color="Pregnancy Rate"))+
  geom_point(data=abortions_all,aes(x=year,y=total,color="Abortion Rate"))+
  ggtitle("Pregnancy & Abortion Rates for All Races and Ages 1990-2009")+
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_colour_manual("", 
                      breaks = c("Pregnancy Rate", "Abortion Rate"),
                      values = c("violetred1", "seagreen4"))
```
  Then, we consider the forces driving the decline in pregnancy rates. Once we have data on these factors separated by age, class, etc, we can weight by percentage contributing to the pregnancy rate. Specifically, the abortion rate decreased 46% for adolescents aged 15-19(Jones 2017:1). Adolescents in this age group had an abortion incidence of 40.3 and abortion rate of 23% once pregnant. That incidence rate was down to 16.3 in 2009, and the abortion rate of adolscents 15-19 was down to 16%(All Curtin Data, my analysis below). 
```{r adolescant abortion incidence}
abortion_incidence_1990 <- filter(abortions_all,year=="1990")$X15.19
abortion_incidence_1990
abortion_incidence_2009  <- filter(abortions_all,year=="2009")$X15.19
abortion_incidence_2009

ad_preg_1990 <- filter(pregnancies_all,year=="1990")$X15.19
ad_abort_1990 <- filter(abortions_all,year=="1990")$X15.19
ad_abortion_rate_1990 <- abort_1990/preg_1990

ad_preg_2009 <- filter(pregnancies_all,year=="2009")$X15.19
ad_abort_2009 <- filter(abortions_all,year=="2009")$X15.19
ad_abortion_rate_2009 <- abort_2009/preg_2009
ad_abortion_rate_2009
ad_abort_1990
```
```{r adolescant visualization, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=pregnancies_all)+
  geom_point(aes(x=year,y=X15.19,color="Pregnancy Rate"))+
  geom_point(data=abortions_all,aes(x=year,y=X15.19,color="Abortion Rate"))+
  ggtitle("Pregnancy & Abortion Rates for All Races, Ages 15-19 1990-2009")+
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_colour_manual("", 
                      breaks = c("Pregnancy Rate", "Abortion Rate"),
                      values = c("orangered2", "navyblue"))
```

  
  Women with incomes less than 100% of the poverty rate had the highest incidence of abortion, and saw an abortion rate decrease relatively consistent with that of the general population(Jones 2017:1). 
  Another factor to consider is permissiveness around premarital sex. There’s generally been a linear upward trend in approval rating of premarital sex since mid-century, but most of that occured in the seventies. 66% of Americans expressed that sex between an unmarried man and woman was acceptable in 2014(Abramowitz memo). 
```{r regressions}
#Here I want to run multiple regressions to prove what's pushing abortion rates, need to ask for help on coding from a GSI
```
